# Slack

Slack is what we'll be using to communicate with each other here in CEA.

## What is it?

For the uninitiated, Slack is essentially team communication software. You can
send group and private messages, upload files, etc.

## Getting into the Slack

Go to http://ut-cea.slack.com and enter your utexas email to create an
account! With this link you can view the web version of Slack, however there
are also desktop and mobile clients.

[Click here](https://slack.com/downloads/) to download Slack for the desktop!
This is, *in my opinion at least*, the easiest way to use Slack.

Search Slack on the Apple App Store or Google Play to get the app so you can
get notifications and whatnot on-the-go.

When using the desktop and mobile clients, the *Slack URL* is the same as above
(ut&#8209;cea.slack.com).

Afterwards, just use the same email address and password you signed up with.

{% endhint %}

## A quick rundown

- Slack messages are separated by *channels*.
    To join a new channel simply click the "+" button next to "Channels" on the
    left side bar. The sidebar only shows the channels you're currently in.

    By default, you'll in included in the #general and #random channels.
    They're pretty much what you'd expect. #general is for messages that need
    to go to everyone and #random is literally for anything (especially memes).
    
- The *Do not disturb* setting turns off notifications between certain times.
    Messages in channels will not send you notifications until the morning, but
    it can be overridden by the sender in direct messages.
